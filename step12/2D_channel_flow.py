# Step 12: 2D Channel Flow
# this another problem solved with the Navier Stokes Eq
# this time the domain is a channel
# and in the U momentum equation we have a source term which makes the fluid
# to move form left to right
# introducing a periodic boundary condition

import numpy as np
import pylab as pl
from pylab import cm
pl.ion()

# The problem will be solve by modules, using functions

# Defininig the function for pressure build-up
